# 8bit-counter
Design files for custom 6 bit counter board

Simple 6 bit counter board with decimal equivalent visualization driven via STM32L452RE

Basic functionality: each bit is controlled by a SPDT switch and represented on a 7-segment display. Since there are only 6 bits, there will be a decimal equivalent between 0 and 63 being displayed on 7-segment displays.

This is a personal project that will be my first attempt at breaking into embedded hardware and firmware design. Ultimately, I want to get as deep as I can go in terms of the hardware where I work with many kind of sensors and even want to dive into RF devices as well. A hopeful dream of mine is to also use my projects to help with my home improvements for when I purchase a home. But as of 07/15/2024, neither I or the housing market is in an ideal spot for a purchase.
